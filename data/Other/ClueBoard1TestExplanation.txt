We tested the room initals by testing the top left cell of some rooms (lighthouse, Kitchen, and Great room),
and we tested other room initials by testing the bottom right cells of some other rooms (Great room again, Entrance Hall). 
Lastly, we tested the room intials of our closet and walkways.

We tested our doorways by simply counting every single doorway by iterating over the legend and using the isDoorway() function 
to sum the total number

In addition, we tested a right facing door in the lighthouse, a down facing door in the kitchen, a right facing door in the 
tower, and an upward facing door in the dungeon. Finally, we tested that rooms that aren't doors to make sure they didn't think
they were doors, and lastly we tested the walkway to make sure it wasnt a door.
